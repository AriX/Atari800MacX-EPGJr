# Atari800MacX
Atari800 Emulator for Mac OSX

Atari800MacX is the Macintosh OS X Port of David Firth's Fantastic Atari 800 Emulator. I have ported the SDL version of the Atrari800 emulator to Mac OS X, and added a full native Cocoa interface, including Preferences, Menus, File Associations, Help and more.

It does not require libSDL2 to be installed separately, but includes it within the application package. It does however require ROM image files from the original Atari systems, which are not included here. 

The full web page for this emulator (including older versions), as well as other Atari/Mac software can be found at http://atarimac.com.

Special Thanks go to Jacek Poplawski for writing the general SDL port, and the entire libSDL team that has made this port possible. (As well as to the whole Atari800 team for their invaluable support and suggestions. Please visit their website at https://atari800.github.io for full info on their emulator core.) 

Many thanks to Daniel Noguerol for his hard work on the original and ported versions of the R: driver. 

Also thanks to Al Yarusso at AtariAge for mirroring the binary and source for many years.,
