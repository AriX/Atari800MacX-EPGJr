Welcome to Atari800MacX&nbsp;, the Atari 800/XL/XE/5200 emulator
for Macintosh OSX. &nbsp;This quick guide is intended to help those
who are new to Atari Emulation get started quickly. &nbsp;Experience
emulator users should also give this section a quick read to help you
get familiar with some of the special features of the Mac version, and new features of this release, 4.0.<br>



<h1>Donationware</h1>



The emulator is released under the GPL license, however many
months/years of work have gone into it. &nbsp;If you use and appreciate
the emulator, please donate to it's development. &nbsp;I no longer take donations personally, but instead ask that you support the Internet Archive if you feel that you should donate. &nbsp; You can do this
by clicking on the menu item Donation... under the Atari800MacX menu, or by <a href="https://archive.org/donate/">using this link</a>.
<h1>OS ROMS</h1>





The emulator requires that you have ROM images for the Atari operating
system and the BASIC language ROM. &nbsp;These files are not
provided with the emulator for legal reasons, but they are widely
available on the internet. &nbsp;The default names for the ROMS
are&nbsp;atariosa.rom, atariosb.rom,
atarixl.rom,
ataribas.rom, and a5200.rom. &nbsp;By default, the emulator expects
the ROM&nbsp;files to be found in the OSRoms folder in the
Atari800MacX
folder. &nbsp;You can select files with different names or in different locations by using the <a href="RomsTab.html">Roms Tab</a> of the Preferences&nbsp;window.<br>




<h1>Starting the Emulator</h1>




Once the emulator is started, with the ROM files properly installed,
you should see a Blue Screen with white letters in the emulator with
the Atari BASIC ready prompt.<br>




<br>




The first thing you will probably want to do is adjust the display to
your liking. &nbsp;There are many options for the Display
characteristics some of which can be accessed from the <a href="DisplayMenu.html">Display Menu</a>, and others which are available from the <a href="DisplayTab.html">Display Tab</a> of the Preferences window. &nbsp;While we are on the topic, please take time to read through all of the documentation on the <a href="preferences.html">Preferences window</a>.
&nbsp;You can open the Preferences window from the Preferences menu
item in the Atari800MacX menu, or by pressing the command and comma
keys. &nbsp;There are many, many options available in this emulator,
and almost everything you can think of can be customized.<br>




<br>



OK, now you have the emulator up and running, you probably would like
to do something besides seeing the BASIC READY prompt, correct?
&nbsp;The emulator is capable of supporting Atari programs on
cartridge, disk, and cassette image files. &nbsp;To use these files,
you can open them by the menu items in the <a href="MediaMenu.html">Media Menu</a>, or through the controls in the <a href="MediaStatus.html">Media Status</a>
Window. &nbsp;You can also drag and drop the files onto the main
emulator window, although if it is a disk image, it will always be put
in drive 1. &nbsp;For a full list of the file types and extensions
supported by the emulator, please see <a href="FileTypes.html">File Types</a>. <br>



<br>



Finally, I suspect that you would like to simulate the controllers you
used to play those great Atari games. &nbsp;The emulator allows you to
use the keyboard, mouse, and USB gamepads/joysticks to do this.
&nbsp;To find out all of the details, please see the <a href="ControllersTab.html">Controllers</a> and <a href="GamepadsTab.html">Gamepads</a> Tabs in the Preferences window.<br>



<h1>What happens if the&nbsp;Emulated Atari crashes?</h1>

If the emulated Atari crashes, due to an illegal instruction, etc., the
emulator will display an Unrecoverable Error dialog. &nbsp;This
normally happens because of a corrupt disk or cartridge image, or one
that is used incorrectly. &nbsp;(It could happen if your OS ROM images
are bad also). &nbsp;Instead of locking up, the way a real Atari would,
the emulator gives you a choice or removing the media, performing a
warm or cold reset, entering the debug monitor, or simply quiting the
emulator. &nbsp;The Unrecoverable Error Dialog is show below, in both
the Windowed and Fullscreen versions.<br>
