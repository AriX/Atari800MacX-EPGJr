This tab allows you to chose the ROM files used in the emulation of the
Atari. &nbsp;These files are not provided with the emulator. &nbsp;To
select
the file, press the select button, and the chosen filename will appear
in
the text field. &nbsp;There are two types of ROMs.
<br>
<br>The first type of ROMs are the standard Operating System ROMs.
By default, files in the OSRoms folder in the
Atari800MacX
folder are chosen, with standard names of atariosb.rom,
atarixl.rom,
ataribas.rom, and a5200.rom.<br>
Note staring in version 5.3, there are no longer two
types of ROM selections for Atari 400/800 machines,
and there is one slot for the selection of ROMs.
If the user would still like to use a OS/A ROM, they can still do so
by selecting it as the 400/800 ROM.  Remember, using confiugrations
you could still create multipe machines with different ROMs.
<br>
<br>
Also, if no ROMS are present, starting in version 5.3, the emulator
will use built in Open Source ROMS from the Altirra emulator (<a href="http://www.virtualdub.org/altirra.html">http://www.virtualdub.org/altirra.html</a>).  If you would like to use one of these
ROMs after selecting a different one, simply check the box next to the
ROM here to use the Altirra version instead.
<br>
<br>
Finally, if after selecting ROMs, you would like to know what the type
of the ROM you have selected is, then use the Identify OS ROMs button
to display a window which will show version information on your selected
ROMs.  This could be useful, for example, for determining if you have a
Atari BASIC ROM which is verison A, B, or C.
<br>
<br>
The second type of ROMs selected on this tab are those for two
of the types of 80 Column graphics display cards. (Note, there is a 3rd type of ROM, those for PBI expansions, and they are selected on the Expansions tab).
<br>
<br>
(Details about the operation of the 80 column cards may be found in the Display Menu help page.)
